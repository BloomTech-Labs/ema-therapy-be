# API Documentation

<strong>Backend deployed at Heroku:</strong> <https://moodmuse-production.herokuapp.com/backend>

<strong>Staging env is deployed at:</strong> <https://moodmuse.herokuapp.com/>

Access GraphQL with the endpoint `/backend`. Database requires an Auth token.

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **yarn install** to install all required dependencies
- **yarn server** to start the local server
- **yarn test** to start server using testing environment

### Node.js, Express, GraphQL, MongoDB/Mongoose

We chose our back-end technology to be flexible and easy to change as needed due to our project being a greenfield project. We knew that lots of changes will occur as the application develops and wanted to make setting up the database quick and painless.
